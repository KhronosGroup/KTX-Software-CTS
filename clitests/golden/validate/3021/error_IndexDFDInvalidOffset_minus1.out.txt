error-3021: Invalid dfdByteOffset.
    dfdByteOffset is 103 but the Data Format Descriptor must immediately follow (with 4 byte alignment) the Level Index so it must be 104.
error-3028: Invalid dfdByteLength. If there is Key/Value Data the dfdByteLength/dfdTotalSize must be equal to kvdByteOffset - dfdByteOffset.
    dfdByteLength is 92 but it must be equal to kvdByteOffset - dfdByteOffset which is 93.
error-4006: Invalid uncompressedByteLength in Level Index. For non-supercompressed files the uncompressedByteLength must match the expected value of byteLength.
    Level 0 uncompressedByteLength is 6629298651489371136 but based on the vkFormat, DFD and image sizes the expected value is 1024.
