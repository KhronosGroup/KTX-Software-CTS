    sgdByteLength is 79 but based on image count of 3 and the BasisLzGlobalHeader the expected value is 241 (20 + 20 * imageCount + endpointsByteLength + selectorsByteLength + tablesByteLength + extendedByteLength).
error-7011: Invalid padding byte value. Every padding byte's value must be 0.
    A padding byte value is 32 before image level 2 at offset 320 but it must be 0.
