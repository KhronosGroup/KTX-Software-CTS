error-4004: Invalid byteOffset in Level Index. byteOffset must match the expected value.
    Level 0 byteOffset is 374 but based on the vkFormat, DFD and image sizes the expected value is 375.
error-8102: Invalid sgdByteLength for BasisLZ/ETC1S. sgdByteLength must be consistent with image count and BasisLzGlobalHeader.
    sgdByteLength is 183 but based on image count of 1 and the BasisLzGlobalHeader the expected value is 182 (20 + 20 * imageCount + endpointsByteLength + selectorsByteLength + tablesByteLength + extendedByteLength).
