    sgdByteLength is 39 but based on image count of 1 and the BasisLzGlobalHeader the expected value is 182 (20 + 20 * imageCount + endpointsByteLength + selectorsByteLength + tablesByteLength + extendedByteLength).
error-7011: Invalid padding byte value. Every padding byte's value must be 0.
    A padding byte value is 9 before image level 0 at offset 232 but it must be 0.
