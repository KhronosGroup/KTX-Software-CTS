error-4004: Invalid byteOffset in Level Index. byteOffset must match the expected value.
    Level 2 byteOffset is 458 but based on the vkFormat, DFD and image sizes the expected value is 459.
error-8102: Invalid sgdByteLength for BasisLZ/ETC1S. sgdByteLength must be consistent with image count and BasisLzGlobalHeader.
    sgdByteLength is 203 but based on image count of 3 and the BasisLzGlobalHeader the expected value is 202 (20 + 20 * imageCount + endpointsByteLength + selectorsByteLength + tablesByteLength + extendedByteLength).
