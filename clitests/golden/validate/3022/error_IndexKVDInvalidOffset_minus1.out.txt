error-3028: Invalid dfdByteLength. If there is Key/Value Data the dfdByteLength/dfdTotalSize must be equal to kvdByteOffset - dfdByteOffset.
    dfdByteLength is 92 but it must be equal to kvdByteOffset - dfdByteOffset which is 91.
error-3022: Invalid kvdByteOffset.
    kvdByteOffset is 195 but the Key/Value Data must immediately follow (with 4 byte alignment) the Data Format Descriptor so it must be 196.
error-6028: Invalid sample in basic DFD block. The samples must match the expected samples of the VkFormat.
    DFD block #1 sample #4 sampleUpper in basic DFD block is 620757247 but the expected value is 255 for VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM.
