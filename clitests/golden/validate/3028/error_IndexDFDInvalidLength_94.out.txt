error-3028: Invalid dfdByteLength. If there is Key/Value Data the dfdByteLength/dfdTotalSize must be equal to kvdByteOffset - dfdByteOffset.
    dfdByteLength is 94 but it must be equal to kvdByteOffset - dfdByteOffset which is 92.
error-3022: Invalid kvdByteOffset.
    kvdByteOffset is 196 but the Key/Value Data must immediately follow (with 4 byte alignment) the Data Format Descriptor so it must be 200.
error-6001: Mismatching dfdTotalSize and dfdByteLength. dfdTotalSize must match dfdByteLength.
    dfdTotalSize is 94 but dfdByteLength is 92 and they must match.
error-6004: Invalid DFD data. Not enough data left to process another DFD block header.
    DFD has 2 byte(s) unprocessed but for a key value entry at least 8 bytes are required.
