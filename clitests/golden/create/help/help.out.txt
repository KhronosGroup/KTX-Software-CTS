ktx create: Create, encode and supercompress a KTX2 file from the input images specified as the
    input-file... arguments and save it as the output-file.

Usage:
  ktx create [OPTION...] <input-file...> <output-file>

      --format <enum>           KTX format enum that specifies the image data format. The enum 
                                names are matching the VkFormats without the VK_FORMAT_ prefix. The 
                                VK_FORMAT_ prefix is ignored if present.
                                When used with --encode it specifies the format of the input files 
                                before the encoding step. In this case it must be one of:
                                    R8_UNORM
                                    R8_SRGB
                                    R8G8_UNORM
                                    R8G8_SRGB
                                    R8G8B8_UNORM
                                    R8G8B8_SRGB
                                    R8G8B8A8_UNORM
                                    R8G8B8A8_SRGB
                                If the format is an ASTC format the ASTC encoder specific options 
                                become valid, otherwise they are ignored.
                                The format will be used to verify and load all input files into a 
                                texture before encoding. Case insensitive. Required.
      --1d                      Create a 1D texture. If not set the texture will be a 2D or 3D 
                                texture.
      --cubemap                 Create a cubemap texture. If not set the texture will be a 2D or 3D 
                                texture.
      --raw                     Create from raw image data.
      --width [0-9]+            Base level width in pixels.
      --height [0-9]+           Base level height in pixels.
      --depth [0-9]+            Base level depth in pixels. If set the texture will be a 3D 
                                texture.
      --layers [0-9]+           Number of layers. If set the texture will be an array texture.
      --levels [0-9]+           Number of mip levels.
      --runtime-mipmap          Runtime mipmap generation mode.
      --generate-mipmap         Causes mipmaps to be generated during texture creation. It enables 
                                the use of 'Generate Mipmap' options. If the --levels is not 
                                specified the maximum possible mip level will be generated. This 
                                option is mutually exclusive with --runtime-mipmap and cannot be 
                                used with UINT or 3D textures.
      --encode <codec>          Encode the created KTX file. Case insensitive.
                                Possible options are: basis-lz | uastc
      --swizzle [rgba01]{4}     KTX swizzle metadata.
      --input-swizzle [rgba01]{4}
                                Pre-swizzle input channels.
      --assign-oetf <oetf>      Force the created texture to have the specified transfer function, 
                                ignoring the transfer function of the input file(s). Case 
                                insensitive.
                                Possible options are: linear | srgb
      --assign-primaries <primaries>
                                Force the created texture to have the specified color primaries, 
                                ignoring the color primaries of the input file(s). Case insensitive.
                                Possible options are: none | bt709 | srgb | bt601-ebu | bt601-smpte 
                                | bt2020 | ciexyz | aces | acescc | ntsc1953 | pal525 | displayp3 |

      --convert-oetf <oetf>     Convert the input image(s) to the specified transfer function, if 
                                different from the transfer function of the input file(s). If both 
                                this and --assign-oetf are specified, conversion will be performed 
                                from the assigned transfer function to the transfer function 
                                specified by this option, if different. Case insensitive.
                                Possible options are: linear | srgb
      --convert-primaries <primaries>
                                Convert the image image(s) to the specified color primaries, if 
                                different from the color primaries of the input file(s) or the one 
                                specified by --assign-primaries. If both this and 
                                --assign-primaries are specified, conversion will be performed from 
                                 the assigned primaries to the primaries specified by this option, 
                                if different. This option is not allowed to be specified when 
                                --assign-primaries is set to 'none'. Case insensitive.
                                Possible options are: bt709 | srgb | bt601-ebu | bt601-smpte |

      --fail-on-color-conversions
                                Generates an error if any of the input images would need to be 
                                color converted.
      --warn-on-color-conversions
                                Generates a warning if any of the input images are color converted.
      --compare-ssim            Calculate encoding structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and 
                                print it to stdout. Requires Basis-LZ or UASTC encoding.
      --compare-psnr            Calculate encoding peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and print it 
                                to stdout. Requires Basis-LZ or UASTC encoding.
      --zstd <level>            Supercompress the data with Zstandard. Cannot be used with ETC1S / 
                                BasisLZ format. Level range is [1,22]. Lower levels give faster but 
                                worse compression. Values above 20 should be used with caution as 
                                they require more memory.
      --zlib <level>            Supercompress the data with ZLIB. Cannot be used with ETC1S / 
                                BasisLZ format. Level range is [1,9]. Lower levels give faster but 
                                worse compression.
      --stdin                   Use stdin as the first input file. (Using a single dash '-' as the 
                                first input file has the same effect)
      --stdout                  Use stdout as the output file. (Using a single dash '-' as the 
                                output file has the same effect)
  -h, --help                    Print this usage message and exit
  -v, --version                 Print the version number of this program and exit
      --testrun                 Indicates test run. If enabled the tool will produce deterministic 
                                output whenever possible

 Encode ASTC options:
      --astc-quality <level>  The quality level configures the quality-performance tradeoff for the 
                              compressor; more complete searches of the search space improve image 
                              quality at the expense of compression time. Default is 'medium'. The 
                              quality level can be set between fastest (0) and exhaustive (100) via 
                              the following fixed quality presets:

                                  Level      |  Quality
                                  ---------- | -----------------------------
                                  fastest    | (equivalent to quality =   0)
                                  fast       | (equivalent to quality =  10)
                                  medium     | (equivalent to quality =  60)
                                  thorough   | (equivalent to quality =  98)
                                  exhaustive | (equivalent to quality = 100)
      --astc-perceptual       The codec should optimize for perceptual error, instead of direct RMS 
                              error. This aims to improve perceived image quality, but typically 
                              lowers the measured PSNR score. Perceptual methods are currently only 
                              available for normal maps and RGB color data.

 Encode BasisLZ options:
      --clevel <level>          BasisLZ compression level, an encoding speed vs. quality level 
                                tradeoff. Range is [0,5], default is 1. Higher values are slower 
                                but give higher quality.
      --qlevel <level>          BasisLZ quality level. Range is [1,255]. Lower gives better 
                                compression/lower quality/faster. Higher gives less 
                                compression/higher quality/slower. --qlevel automatically 
                                determines values for --max-endpoints, --max-selectors, 
                                --endpoint-rdo-threshold and --selector-rdo-threshold for the 
                                target quality level. Setting these options overrides the values 
                                determined by --qlevel which defaults to 128 if neither it nor 
                                --max-endpoints and --max-selectors have been set.
      --max-endpoints <arg>     Manually set the maximum number of color endpoint clusters. Range 
                                is [1,16128]. Default is 0, unset.
      --endpoint-rdo-threshold <arg>
                                Set endpoint RDO quality threshold. The default is 1.25. Lower is 
                                higher quality but less quality per output bit (try [1.0,3.0]). 
                                This will override the value chosen by --qlevel.
      --max-selectors <arg>     Manually set the maximum number of color selector clusters from 
                                [1,16128]. Default is 0, unset.
      --selector-rdo-threshold <arg>
                                Set selector RDO quality threshold. The default is 1.25. Lower is 
                                higher quality but less quality per output bit (try [1.0,3.0]). 
                                This will override the value chosen by --qlevel.
      --no-endpoint-rdo         Disable endpoint rate distortion optimizations. Slightly faster, 
                                less noisy output, but lower quality per output bit. Default is to 
                                do endpoint RDO.
      --no-selector-rdo         Disable selector rate distortion optimizations. Slightly faster, 
                                less noisy output, but lower quality per output bit. Default is to 
                                do selector RDO.

 Encode UASTC options:
      --uastc-quality <level>   UASTC compression level, an encoding speed vs. quality level 
                                tradeoff. Range is [0,4], default is 1. Higher values are slower 
                                but give higher quality.
      --uastc-rdo               Enable UASTC RDO post-processing.
      --uastc-rdo-l <lambda>    Set UASTC RDO quality scalar to the specified value. Lower values 
                                yield higher quality/larger supercompressed files, higher values 
                                yield lower quality/smaller supercompressed files. A good range to 
                                try is [.25,10]. For normal maps a good range is [.25,.75]. The 
                                full range is [.001,10.0]. Default is 1.0.
      --uastc-rdo-d <dictsize>  Set UASTC RDO dictionary size in bytes. Default is 4096. Lower 
                                values=faster, but give less compression. Range is [64,65536].
      --uastc-rdo-b <scale>     Set UASTC RDO max smooth block error scale. Range is [1.0,300.0]. 
                                Default is 10.0, 1.0 is disabled. Larger values suppress more 
                                artifacts (and allocate more bits) on smooth blocks.
      --uastc-rdo-s <deviation>
                                Set UASTC RDO max smooth block standard deviation. Range is 
                                [.01,65536.0]. Default is 18.0. Larger values expand the range of 
                                blocks considered smooth.
      --uastc-rdo-f             Do not favor simpler UASTC modes in RDO mode.
      --uastc-rdo-m             Disable RDO multithreading (slightly higher compression, 
                                deterministic).

 Encode common options:
      --normal-mode      Optimizes for encoding textures with normal data. If the input texture has 
                         three or four linear components it is assumed to be a three component 
                         linear normal map storing unit length normals as (R=X, G=Y, B=Z). A fourth 
                         component will be ignored. The map will be converted to a two component 
                         X+Y normal map stored as (RGB=X, A=Y) prior to encoding. If unsure that 
                         your normals are unit length, use --normalize. If the input has 2 linear 
                         components it is assumed to be an X+Y map of unit normals.
                         The Z component can be recovered programmatically in shader code by using 
                         the equations:
                             nml.xy = texture(...).ga;              // Load in [0,1]
                             nml.xy = nml.xy * 2.0 - 1.0;           // Unpack to [-1,1]
                             nml.z = sqrt(1 - dot(nml.xy, nml.xy)); // Compute Z
                         ETC1S / BasisLZ encoding, RDO is disabled (no selector RDO, no endpoint 
                         RDO) to provide better quality.
      --threads <count>  Sets the number of threads to use during encoding. By default, encoding 
                         will use the number of threads reported by thread::hardware_concurrency or 
                         1 if value returned is 0.
      --no-sse           Forbid use of the SSE instruction set. Ignored if CPU does not support 
                         SSE. SSE can only be disabled on the basis-lz and uastc compressors.

 Generate Mipmap options:
      --mipmap-filter <filter>  Specifies the filter to use when generating the mipmaps. Case 
                                insensitive.
                                Possible options are: box | tent | bell | b-spline | mitchell | 
                                blackman | lanczos3 | lanczos4 | lanczos6 | lanczos12 | kaiser | 
                                gaussian | catmullrom | quadratic_interp | quadratic_approx |  
                                quadratic_mix. Defaults to lanczos4.
      --mipmap-filter-scale <float>
                                The filter scale to use. Defaults to 1.0.
      --mipmap-wrap <mode>      Specify how to sample pixels near the image boundaries. Case 
                                insensitive.
                                Possible options are: wrap | reflect | clamp. Defaults to clamp.
