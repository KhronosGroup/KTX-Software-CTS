ktx transcode: Transcode the KTX file specified as the input-file argument,
    optionally supercompress the result, and save it as the output-file.

Usage:
  ktx transcode [OPTION...] <input-file> <output-file>

      --target <target>  Target transcode format. Block compressed transcode targets can only be 
                         saved in raw format. Case-insensitive.
                         Possible options are: etc-rgb | etc-rgba | eac-r11 | eac-rg11 | bc1 | bc3 
                         | bc4 | bc5 | bc7 | astc | r8 | rg8 | rgb8 | rgba8.
                         etc-rgb is ETC1; etc-rgba, eac-r11 and eac-rg11 are ETC2.
      --zstd <level>     Supercompress the data with Zstandard. Cannot be used with ETC1S / BasisLZ 
                         format. Level range is [1,22]. Lower levels give faster but worse 
                         compression. Values above 20 should be used with caution as they require 
                         more memory.
      --zlib <level>     Supercompress the data with ZLIB. Cannot be used with ETC1S / BasisLZ 
                         format. Level range is [1,9]. Lower levels give faster but worse 
                         compression.
  -s, --stdin            Use stdin as the input file
  -h, --help             Print this usage message and exit
  -v, --version          Print the version number of this program and exit
      --testrun          Indicates test run. If enabled the tool will produce deterministic output 
                         whenever possible
