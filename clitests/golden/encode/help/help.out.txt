ktx encode: Encode the KTX file specified as the input-file argument,
    optionally supercompress the result, and save it as the output-file.

Usage:
  ktx encode [OPTION...] <input-file> <output-file>

      --format <enum>   KTX format enum that specifies the KTX file output format. The enum names 
                        are matching the VkFormats without the VK_FORMAT_ prefix. The VK_FORMAT_ 
                        prefix is ignored if present.
                        It can't be used with --codec.
                        The value must be an ASTC format. When specified the ASTC encoder specific 
                        options becomes valid. Case insensitive.
      --codec <target>  Target codec. With each encoding option the encoder specific options become 
                        valid, otherwise they are ignored. Case-insensitive.
                        Possible options are: basis-lz | uastc | uastc-ldr-4x4 | uastc-hdr-4x4 | 
                        uastc-hdr-6x6i
      --compare-ssim    Calculate encoding structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and print it 
                        to stdout. Requires Basis-LZ, UASTC or ASTC encoding.
      --compare-psnr    Calculate encoding peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and print it to 
                        stdout. Requires Basis-LZ, UASTC or ASTC encoding.
      --zstd <level>    Supercompress the data with Zstandard. Cannot be used with ETC1S / BasisLZ 
                        format. Level range is [1,22]. Lower levels give faster but worse 
                        compression. Values above 20 should be used with caution as they require 
                        more memory.
      --zlib <level>    Supercompress the data with ZLIB. Cannot be used with ETC1S / BasisLZ 
                        format. Level range is [1,9]. Lower levels give faster but worse 
                        compression.
      --stdin           Use stdin as the input file. (Using a single dash '-' as the input file has 
                        the same effect)
      --stdout          Use stdout as the output file. (Using a single dash '-' as the output file 
                        has the same effect)
  -h, --help            Print this usage message and exit
  -v, --version         Print the version number of this program and exit
      --testrun         Indicates test run. If enabled the tool will produce deterministic output 
                        whenever possible

 Encode ASTC options:
      --astc-quality <level>  The quality level configures the quality-performance tradeoff for the 
                              compressor; more complete searches of the search space improve image 
                              quality at the expense of compression time. Default is 'medium'. The 
                              quality level can be set between fastest (0) and exhaustive (100) via 
                              the following fixed quality presets:

                                  Level      |  Quality
                                  ---------- | -----------------------------
                                  fastest    | (equivalent to quality =   0)
                                  fast       | (equivalent to quality =  10)
                                  medium     | (equivalent to quality =  60)
                                  thorough   | (equivalent to quality =  98)
                                  exhaustive | (equivalent to quality = 100)
      --astc-perceptual       The codec should optimize for perceptual error, instead of direct RMS 
                              error. This aims to improve perceived image quality, but typically 
                              lowers the measured PSNR score. Perceptual methods are currently only 
                              available for normal maps and RGB color data.

 Encode BasisLZ options:
      --clevel <level>          BasisLZ compression level, an encoding speed vs. quality level 
                                tradeoff. Range is [0,6], default is 1. Higher values are slower 
                                but give higher quality.
      --qlevel <level>          BasisLZ quality level. Range is [1,255]. Lower gives better 
                                compression/lower quality/faster. Higher gives less 
                                compression/higher quality/slower. --qlevel automatically 
                                determines values for --max-endpoints, --max-selectors, 
                                --endpoint-rdo-threshold and --selector-rdo-threshold for the 
                                target quality level. Setting these options overrides the values 
                                determined by --qlevel which defaults to 128 if neither it nor 
                                --max-endpoints and --max-selectors have been set.
      --max-endpoints <arg>     Manually set the maximum number of color endpoint clusters. Range 
                                is [1,16128]. Default is 0, unset.
      --endpoint-rdo-threshold <arg>
                                Set endpoint RDO quality threshold. The default is 1.25. Lower is 
                                higher quality but less quality per output bit (try [1.0,3.0]). 
                                This will override the value chosen by --qlevel.
      --max-selectors <arg>     Manually set the maximum number of color selector clusters from 
                                [1,16128]. Default is 0, unset.
      --selector-rdo-threshold <arg>
                                Set selector RDO quality threshold. The default is 1.25. Lower is 
                                higher quality but less quality per output bit (try [1.0,3.0]). 
                                This will override the value chosen by --qlevel.
      --no-endpoint-rdo         Disable endpoint rate distortion optimizations. Slightly faster, 
                                less noisy output, but lower quality per output bit. Default is to 
                                do endpoint RDO.
      --no-selector-rdo         Disable selector rate distortion optimizations. Slightly faster, 
                                less noisy output, but lower quality per output bit. Default is to 
                                do selector RDO.

 Encode UASTC options:
      --uastc-quality <level>   UASTC compression level, an encoding speed vs. quality level 
                                tradeoff. Range is [0,4], default is 1. Higher values are slower 
                                but give higher quality.
      --uastc-rdo               Enable UASTC RDO post-processing.
      --uastc-rdo-l <lambda>    Set UASTC RDO quality scalar to the specified value. Lower values 
                                yield higher quality/larger supercompressed files, higher values 
                                yield lower quality/smaller supercompressed files. A good range to 
                                try is [.25,10]. For normal maps a good range is [.25,.75]. The 
                                full range is [.001,10.0]. Default is 1.0.
      --uastc-rdo-d <dictsize>  Set UASTC RDO dictionary size in bytes. Default is 4096. Lower 
                                values=faster, but give less compression. Range is [64,65536].
      --uastc-rdo-b <scale>     Set UASTC RDO max smooth block error scale. Range is [1.0,300.0]. 
                                Default is 10.0, 1.0 is disabled. Larger values suppress more 
                                artifacts (and allocate more bits) on smooth blocks.
      --uastc-rdo-s <deviation>
                                Set UASTC RDO max smooth block standard deviation. Range is 
                                [.01,65536.0]. Default is 18.0. Larger values expand the range of 
                                blocks considered smooth.
      --uastc-rdo-f             Do not favor simpler UASTC modes in RDO mode.
      --uastc-rdo-m             Disable RDO multithreading (slightly higher compression, 
                                deterministic).
      --uastc-hdr-uber-mode     Allow the UASTC HDR 4x4 encoder to try varying the CEM 11 selectors 
                                more for slightly higher quality (slower). This may negatively 
                                impact BC6H quality, however.
      --uastc-hdr-ultra-quant   Allow the UASTC HDR 4x4 encoder to try and find better quantized 
                                CEM 7/11 endpoint values (slower).
      --uastc-hdr-favor-astc    By default the UASTC HDR 4x4 encoder tries to strike a balance or 
                                even slightly favor BC6H quality. If this option is specified, ASTC 
                                HDR 4x4 quality is favored instead.
      --rec-2020                The input image's gamut is Rec. 2020 vs. the default Rec. 709 - for 
                                accurate colorspace error calculations.
      --uastc-hdr-lambda <level>
                                Enables rate distortion optimization (RDO). The higher this value, 
                                the lower the quality, but the smaller the file size. Try 
                                100-20000, or higher values on some images.
      --uastc-hdr-6x6i-level <level>
                                Controls the 6x6 HDR intermediate mode encoder performance vs. max 
                                quality tradeoff. Range is [0,12]. Default level is 2.

 Encode common options:
      --normal-mode      Optimizes for encoding textures with normal data. If the input texture has 
                         three or four linear components it is assumed to be a three component 
                         linear normal map storing unit length normals as (R=X, G=Y, B=Z). A fourth 
                         component will be ignored. The map will be converted to a two component 
                         X+Y normal map stored as (RGB=X, A=Y) prior to encoding. If unsure that 
                         your normals are unit length, use --normalize. If the input has 2 linear 
                         components it is assumed to be an X+Y map of unit normals.
                         The Z component can be recovered programmatically in shader code by using 
                         the equations:
                             nml.xy = texture(...).ga;              // Load in [0,1]
                             nml.xy = nml.xy * 2.0 - 1.0;           // Unpack to [-1,1]
                             nml.z = sqrt(1 - dot(nml.xy, nml.xy)); // Compute Z
                         ETC1S / BasisLZ encoding, RDO is disabled (no selector RDO, no endpoint 
                         RDO) to provide better quality.
      --threads <count>  Sets the number of threads to use during encoding. By default, encoding 
                         will use the number of threads reported by thread::hardware_concurrency or 
                         1 if value returned is 0.
      --no-sse           Forbid use of the SSE instruction set. Ignored if CPU does not support 
                         SSE. SSE can only be disabled on the basis-lz and uastc compressors.
