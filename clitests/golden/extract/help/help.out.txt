ktx extract: Extract one or multiple images from the KTX2 file specified as the input-file argument
    and, based on the format, save them as Raw, EXR or PNG image files to the output-path.

Usage:
  ktx extract [OPTION...] <input-file> <output>

      --stdout              Use stdout as the output file. (Using a single dash '-' as the output 
                            file has the same effect)
      --transcode <target>  Transcode the texture to the target format before executing the extract 
                            steps. Requires the input file to be transcodable. Block compressed 
                            transcode targets can only be saved in raw format. Case-insensitive.
                            Possible options are: etc-rgb | etc-rgba | eac-r11 | eac-rg11 | bc1 | 
                            bc3 | bc4 | bc5 | bc7 | astc | r8 | rg8 | rgb8 | rgba8.
                            etc-rgb is ETC1; etc-rgba, eac-r11 and eac-rg11 are ETC2.
      --uri <uri>           KTX Fragment URI.
      --level [0-9]+ | all  Level to extract. When 'all' is used every level is exported. Defaults 
                            to 0.
      --layer [0-9]+ | all  Layer to extract. When 'all' is used every layer is exported. Defaults 
                            to 0.
      --face [0-5] | all    Face to extract. When 'all' is used every face is exported. Defaults to 
                            0.
      --depth [0-9]+ | all  Depth slice to extract. When 'all' is used every depth is exported. 
                            Defaults to 0.
      --all                 Extract every image slice from the texture.
      --raw                 Extract the raw image data without any conversion.
      --stdin               Use stdin as the input file. (Using a single dash '-' as the input file 
                            has the same effect)
  -h, --help                Print this usage message and exit
  -v, --version             Print the version number of this program and exit
      --testrun             Indicates test run. If enabled the tool will produce deterministic 
                            output whenever possible
