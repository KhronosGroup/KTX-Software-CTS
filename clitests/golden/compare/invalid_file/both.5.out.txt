error-4004: Invalid byteOffset in Level Index. byteOffset must match the expected value.
    Level 2 byteOffset is 458 but based on the vkFormat, DFD and image sizes the expected value is 459.
error-8102: Invalid sgdByteLength for BasisLZ/ETC1S. sgdByteLength must be consistent with image count and BasisLzGlobalHeader.
    sgdByteLength is 203 but based on image count of 3 and the BasisLzGlobalHeader the expected value is 202 (20 + 20 * imageCount + endpointsByteLength + selectorsByteLength + tablesByteLength + extendedByteLength).
warning-5004: Non-conformant texture file accepted by libktx.
    KTX 2.0 file does not conform to the specification but it is currently accepted by libktx.

error-3007: Invalid pixelHeight. pixelHeight must not be 0 for a block compressed formats.
    pixelHeight is 0 but for block-compressed VK_FORMAT_ASTC_3x3x3_UNORM_BLOCK_EXT it must not be 0.
error-3009: Invalid pixelHeight. pixelHeight must not be 0 if pixelDepth is not also 0.
    pixelHeight is 0 and pixelDepth is 4 but pixelHeight must not be 0 if pixelDepth is not 0 as well.
