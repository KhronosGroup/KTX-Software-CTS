ktx deflate: Deflate (supercompress) the KTX file specified as the input-file
    and save it as the output-file.

Usage:
  ktx deflate [OPTION...] <input-file> <output-file>

      --quiet               Don't print warning when input file is already supercompressed.
      --warnings-as-errors  Exit with error when input file is already supercompressed
      --zstd <level>        Supercompress the data with Zstandard. Cannot be used with ETC1S / 
                            BasisLZ format. Level range is [1,22]. Lower levels give faster but 
                            worse compression. Values above 20 should be used with caution as they 
                            require more memory.
      --zlib <level>        Supercompress the data with ZLIB. Cannot be used with ETC1S / BasisLZ 
                            format. Level range is [1,9]. Lower levels give faster but worse 
                            compression.
      --stdin               Use stdin as the input file. (Using a single dash '-' as the input file 
                            has the same effect)
      --stdout              Use stdout as the output file. (Using a single dash '-' as the output 
                            file has the same effect)
  -h, --help                Print this usage message and exit
  -v, --version             Print the version number of this program and exit
      --testrun             Indicates test run. If enabled the tool will produce deterministic 
                            output whenever possible
